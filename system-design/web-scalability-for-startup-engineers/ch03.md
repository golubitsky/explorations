- front-end
  - client
  - network components between client and your data center
  - parts of data center that directly respond to client
- highest throughput and concurrency demands -> scalability critical
- properties of app
  - mostly stateless
  - depend on caching
  - allow horizontal scalability by adding more hardware
- state
  - 3 ways to store **session data**
    - cookies
      - cookie needs to be sent with every HTTP request
      - entire state is stored in cookie
      - could be not as performant if state is large
    - delegate session storage to external data store
      - same as cookie, but cookie stores only session_id
      - data is stored in data store, e.g. Redis
    - use load balancer that supports sticky sessions
      - do nothing in the application layer
      - load balancer assigns cookie and inspects cookie in headers to send subsequent requests to same server
      - this approach breaks the fundamental approach of statelessness
        - cannot restart, decommission, safely auto-scale the load balancer without breaking user sessions
  - **file storage**
    - S3 or Azure Blob Storage
    - use CDN
- components
  - DNS

  - load balancer / reverse proxy
  - web server
