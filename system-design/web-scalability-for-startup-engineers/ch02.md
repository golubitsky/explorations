- Methods of scaling
  - Add more clones
    - works for stateless components
  - Functional partitioning
    - infrastructure: divide data centers into various server types
    - SOA
    - modularization
  - Data partitioning
    - "share nothing"
    - consistent caching
- single point of failure
  - any component that is not redundant
- Redundancy is having more than one copy of each piece of data or each component of the infrastructure
- Self-healing is a property going beyond graceful failure handling; it is the ability to detect and fix problems automatically without human intervention
- "the line between decoupling and overengineering is very fine"
