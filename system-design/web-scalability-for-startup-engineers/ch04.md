- functional partitioning (i.e. service oriented architecture)
  - different services can have different access patterns (i.e. more read-heavy or write-heavy)
  - enables services to be scaled independently
    - more options, like using different data stores or programming languages
  - possible downside is future/unplanned integration of those services might be more costly
  - begins to shine when team size > 10-20 engineers
