- **Functional Requirements**

  - Inputs and outputs of the system
  - API Specification

- **Non-Functional Requirements**
  - **Scalability**
    - Ability of the system to adjust its hardware usage easily to support its load
  - **Availability**
    - Percentage of time the system can accept inputs and return the desired response
  - **Performance**
    - **Latency/P99**
      - Time taken for the user's request to return a response
    - **Bandwidth**
      - Maximum request rate
    - **Throughput**
      - Current request rate being processed by the system
      - Commonly used interchangeably (incorrectly) with bandwidth
      - Inverse of latency â€” a system with low latency has high throughput
  - **Fault Tolerance**
    - Ability of the system to continue operating when some components fail
    - Prevention of permanent harm resulting from downtime
  - **Security**
    - Prevention of unauthorized access to systems
  - **Privacy**
    - Access control to personally identifiable information (PII)
  - **Accuracy**
    - A system's data may not need to be accurate
    - Accuracy trade-offs to improve cost/complexity is often a relevant discussion
  - **Consistency**
    - Whether data in all nodes/machines must match
