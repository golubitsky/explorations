# Goals

## Phase 1

- RabbitMQ
- A couple of apps
- Ability to define MQ objects (e.g. topics, queues) in a separate repo.
  - A single command that will apply these definitions to the queue instance.
- All of the above in multiple environments (phase 3?).

## Phase 2

- Configuration is automatically parsable into an informative diagram.
  - Might start with:
    - One service publishing
    - One service subscribing
    - Diagram auto-populates from config.
      - See: https://medium.com/@90valentin/visualizing-your-rabbitmq-instance-with-alicemq-787a422c03de
