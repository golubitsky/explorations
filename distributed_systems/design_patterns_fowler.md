## üß≠ Coordination & Leadership

For handling leadership election, failover, and control flow among distributed nodes.

## üîÅ Replication & Consistency

Foundational to data durability, fault tolerance, and consensus across replicas.

- [Follower Reads](https://lnkd.in/gVVSCYvN)
- [Majority Quorum](https://lnkd.in/gXYHNniN)
- [Replicated Log](https://lnkd.in/gqjWa9tw)
- [Paxos](https://lnkd.in/gm6qqNPc)

## üí¨ Communication & Message Handling

Patterns focused on batching, pipelining, and managing request lifecycles.

- [Request Batch](https://lnkd.in/g2MBCiE3)
- [Request Pipeline](https://lnkd.in/gKjhZ8cK)
- [Request Waiting List](https://lnkd.in/gRB_kBZS)
- [Single Socket Channel](https://lnkd.in/gYz9Nsvi)
- [Singular Update Queue](https://lnkd.in/gKd_zK-N)

## üì° Dissemination & Gossip

How information is propagated across systems in a decentralized manner.

## ‚úÖ Idempotency & Fault Handling

Designing for safe retries and avoiding duplication.

- [Idempotent Receiver](https://lnkd.in/gPJCscbj)

---

## ü™£ Watermarks & Progress Tracking

Helps track the state of processing, especially in streaming or log-based systems.

- [High Watermark](https://lnkd.in/gJBUrcgm)
- [Low Watermark](https://lnkd.in/gp7neH2D)
- [Segmented Log](https://lnkd.in/g7k9wJkX)

## üß† Study Tip

For each pattern:
- Summarize in your own words
- Draw a diagram
- Identify a real-world system that uses it (e.g., Kafka, Raft, Cassandra)
- Practice explaining trade-offs in mock interviews
