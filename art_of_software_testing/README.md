## Why this exists

On page 1 of Glenford Myers' _The Art Of Software Testing_, it is written:

Before beginning the book, it is strongly recommended that you take the following short test. The problem is the testing of the following program:

> The program reads three integer values from a card. The three values are interpreted as representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program prints a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.

On a sheet of paper, write a set of test cases (i.e., specific sets of data) that you feel would adequately test this program. When you have completed this, turn the page to analyze your tests.

## Run the tests

```
make test
```
